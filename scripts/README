Running experiments:

First modify the `work_dir` attribute in both `run.sh` and `harvest.sh` to the directory where you want to store the results. Then run the following command:
```bash
./run.sh
```

After finishing the experiments, you can run the following command to harvest the results:
```bash
./harvest.sh
```
